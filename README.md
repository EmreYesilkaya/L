# Drink Management System

This project is a C++ based Drink Management System created by Emre Ye≈üilkaya. It is designed to efficiently manage a variety of drinks, including alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. The system leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create a robust and flexible management solution.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several files, each serving a specific purpose:

- **main.cpp**: The entry point of the application.
- **Spirits.cpp & Spirits.h**: Source and header files for managing spirits (alcoholic drinks).
- **Wine.cpp & Wine.h**: Source and header files for managing wines.
- **NonAlcoholicDrink.cpp & NonAlcoholicDrink.h**: Source and header files for managing non-alcoholic drinks.
- **Drink.cpp & Drink.h**: Source and header files for the base class of all drinks.
- **InterfaceDrinkFeatures.h**: Header file for defining the interface for drink features.
- **AlcoholicDrink.cpp & AlcoholicDrink.h**: Source and header files for managing alcoholic drinks.
- **Beer.cpp & Beer.h**: Source and header files for managing beers.
- **Accounting.cpp & Accounting.h**: Source and header files for accounting-related functionalities.
